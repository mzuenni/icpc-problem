	\begin{block}{Problem}
		Given pairs~$(a, b)$, multiply them with a value in~$[0,1]$, sum them up such that the result is as big as possible and the ratio between~$a$ and~$b$ is~$x$.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		We can partition the input into two sets:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Those pairs with~$\frac{a}{b}\ge x$
			\item Those with~$\frac{a}{b}<x$
		\end{itemize}
		Observe that an optimal solution always contains all entries of one of the sets.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Take all entries from set~$A$ and add entries from set~$B$ one by one.
			\item Getting as much as possible~$\iff$ approach ratio~$x$ as slow as possible.
			\item Thus, first take entries with ratio~close to~$x$.
		\end{itemize}
    The total runtime is in~$\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ to sort entries by their ratio.

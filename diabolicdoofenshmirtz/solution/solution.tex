	\begin{block}{Problem}
		You can query $t$ and the judge responds with $t\bmod x$.
		Your goal is to find $x$.
		However, the $t$ values must be strictly increasing.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		Try to find $t$ such that $x\leq t<2\cdot x$. The answer is then simply $t - (t\bmod x)$.\\
		\pause
		\smallskip
		How to find the right $t$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Since $x$ could be $1$, we can only try $t=1$ as the first query.
			\pause
			\item If this $t$ is less than $x$, we know that $x$ is at least $2$.
			\item Thus, the largest possible $t$ we can now try is $t=3$.
			\pause
			\item If this $t$ is less than $x$, we know that $x$ is at least $4$.
			\item Thus, the largest possible $t$ we can now try is $t=7$.
			\pause
			\item[$\Rightarrow$] Try $t=2^i-1$ until $t\bmod x\neq t$. Then answer with $t - (t\bmod x)$.

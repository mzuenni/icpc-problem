	\begin{block}{Problem}
		Given a string where runs of consecutive equal characters are removed if the run has length larger then~$k$, simulate~$q$ inserts of characters into this string.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item You just need to simulate this efficiently.
      \item Either use a \emph{treap} and keep track of run lengths.
      \item Or a \emph{binary search tree} which contains runs.
			\item In both cases your data structure needs to efficiently do this:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Insert a character at a position.
				\item Find the length of a run at a position.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		Total runtime~$\mathcal{O}(q\log(n))$

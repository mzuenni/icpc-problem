	\begin{block}{Problem}
		Given a Graph~$G$, change the edges of a single vertex such that the resulting graph is a simple cycle.
		\pause
		Alternatively, check whether~$G$ without a single vertex is a path.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		We only need to check a constant number of candidate vertices:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item One vertex with degree greater~$3$.
			\item All vertices with degree~$3$ which are adjacent to all other vertices with degree~$3$.
			\item One vertex with degree~$0$.
			\item One vertex with degree~$1$.
			\item One vertex.
		\end{enumerate}
		The check if~$G$ without a vertex is a path can be done in~$\mathcal{O}(n)$ and thus, the solution is in~$\mathcal{O}(n)$.

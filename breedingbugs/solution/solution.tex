	\begin{block}{Problem}
		Given $n$ positive integers, how many can you select such that no two  selected integers sum up to a prime.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		First, observe that we can select at most one $1$ since $1+1=2$ and $2$ is prime.\\
		\pause
		\smallskip
		
		Let's rephrase the problem in terms of graph theory:
		Given a graph with $n$ vertices where two vertices are connected iff their sum is prime, find a maximum independent set.\\
		\pause
		\smallskip
		Now observe the following properties:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item No two vertices sum up to $2$.
			\item All primes that some vertices sum up to are odd.
			\item The sum of two numbers is only odd if we sum up an even and an odd number.
			\pause
			\item[$\Rightarrow$] The given graph is \emph{bipartite}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The complement of a maximum independent set is a minimum vertex cover.
			\item For bipartite graphs, the minimum vertex cover and the matching have the same size.
			\pause
			\item[$\Rightarrow$] The answer is $n-|\text{matching}|$.
			\smallskip
			\pause
			\item A maximum matching can be found in many ways:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Any flow algorithm
				\item Kuhn's algorithm
				\item Hopcroft Karp's algorithm
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

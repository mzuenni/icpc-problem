	\begin{block}{Problem}
		Given a text with~$n$ words separated by spaces with total length~$W$, replace some spaces with newlines such that the total height plus width of the text is minimized.
	\end{block}
	\pause
	\begin{block}{Solution}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For a given width~$w$ we can find the minimal height greedily by only adding newlines when needed.
      \item The next position where a newline is needed can be found in~$\mathcal{O}(1)$ with a prefix sum over the lengths of the words.
			\item Therefore, the minimal height can be found in~$\mathcal{O}(\frac{W}{w})$.
			\pause
			\item Calculating this for every width is in~$\mathcal{O}(W\log(W))$.
		\end{itemize}
